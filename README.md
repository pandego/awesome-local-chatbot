# An Awesome Local ChatBot ðŸ¦¾ðŸ¤–
A repo to facilitate the creation of an awesome **local** ChatBot.
Everything is set in the `docker-compose.yml`. You'll have 3 services:
  - The LLM endpoint ðŸ‘‰ [Ollama](https://ollama.com/library);
  - The Image Generator endpoint ðŸ‘‰ [Stable Diffusion WebUI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui);
  - The Frontend ðŸ‘‰ [Open WebUI](https://docs.openwebui.com/).

## Pre-requisits
- Debian OS (Ubuntu or WSL)
- Docker Engine installed
- Nvidia Graphics is a plus

# Environment
This was testing on **Ubuntu only**, but it should work well on **MacOS** and **Windows WSL**.

Apart from that you will need somethings installed:

- [Docker & Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/ubuntu/)
- [Nvidia Runtime for Docker](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html#installation)
- Bash shell _(obviously)_

# Deployment
In order to deploy this Local ChatBot, you need to set a few things first:
- Clone this repository and navigate into it:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/pandego/awesome-local-chatbot.git
  cd awesome-local-chatbot
  ```
  
### The `.env` File
- Let's keep things clean. So first, copy `default.env` into `.env`:
  ```bash
  mv default.env .env
  ```
- If you're using **Groq** or **OpenAI** instead of **Ollama**, make sure to add the correspondent API keys in your recently created `.env` file.
- Set up your backup files directory in the `.env` file. Check for variables ending in `_DIR`.
- If you wish to customize the icon on the WebAPP, you can add your own, simple replace the path on the varable `CUSTOM_FAVICON_DIR`

### Deploy it!
- Everything is set in the `docker-compose.yml`. All you have to do now is launch the bash script `deploy_this_awesome_chatbot.sh`:
    ```bash
    chmod +x deploy_this_awesome_chatbot.sh  # optional
    sh deploy_this_awesome_chatbot.sh
    ```
_Et VoilÃ  !_ ðŸŽˆ
